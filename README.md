<h1 align="center"> Hello Everyone </h1>
<h2 align="center"> I am Nidarsana M </h2>
<p align="center"> This is my project on designing a <b>Personal Portfolio</b> </p>
<p align="center"> In this README file, I am going to brief you about the features I have used in my Personal Portfolio </p>
<br>
<h3>HOME PAGE:</h3>
<p>On the home page, as soon as the tab is opened, I have used an <b>animation. This scrolls the image to the right, down, left and then top.</b> There is an introduction box with my photo on it, which was made using flex.Below this are the buttons which navigate to other webpages. The background and buttons are given good contrast. Initially,<b> the buttons are faded. As soon as we hover over it, they become dark.</b></p>

<br>
<h3>ABOUT PAGE:</h3>
<p>On the about page, I have mentioned my hobbies listed one below the other. Each hobby is mentioned with an image in the shape of a circle with a border of the same shape. <b>On hovering the size of the image reduces and the border thickens.</b> Not only this but the <b>image starts rotating on hovering.</b> This is the feature I have used here.</p>

<h3>EDUCATIONAL PROFILE:</h3>
<p>The educational profile page begins with an <b>animation of a teacher greeting and teaching. This runs infinitely.</b></p>

<p>Below it, I have included my school and college information along with their respective website links. Under the school part, I have included a feature of <b>'Hover to know my marks' which reveals my marks on hovering over it.</b></p>

<h3>PROJECTS AND OTHER SKILLS:</h3>
<p>The projects and other skills is a simple webpage which has two images aligned without any space between them. The background has been tried to give a colour suiting its content.</p>
<br>
<h3>CONTACT ME:</h3>
<p>The contact me page is very special because, it <b>splits the screen into two.</b> On the left hand side, it has whatsapp, phone and e-mail related content. The right side has LinkedIn content. The interesting feature about the contact me page is that it has a <b>colour changing backgrond that runs infinitely</b>. The colours suit the text color and enhance the appearance of the webpage</p>

<h3> SELECTION COLOR:</h3>
<p> I have also changed the color of text selection from default to white in olive green background.</p>

<h3>COMMON FEATURES:</h3>
1. I have used suitable and matching <b>colour combinations, appropriate background and those which do not affect eyes directly.</b><br>
2. I have tried my baest at making the <b>alignment</b> perfect.<br>
3. Colours are used such that they do not get hidden in the background.<br>
4. Each page apart from the home page has a <b>link which when pressed redirects us back to the home page.</b><br>
5. Appropriate use of <b>icons near the title of the webpage</b> have been taken care of.
