<h1 align="center"> Hello Everyone </h1>
<h2 align="center"> I am Nidarsana M </h2>
<p align="center"> This is my project on designing a Personal Portfolio </p>
<p align="center"> In this README file, I am going to brief you about the features I have used in my <bold> Personal Portfolio </bold> </p>
<br>
<h3>HOME PAGE:</h3>
<p>On the home page, as soon as the tab is opened, I have used an animation. This scrolls the image to the right, down, left and then top. There is an introduction box with my photo on it, which was made using flex.Below this are the button which navigate to other webpages. The background and buttons are given good contrast. Initially, the buttons are faded. As soon as we hover over it, they become dark.</p>

<h3>ABOUT PAGE:</h3>
<p>On the about page, I have mentioned my hobbies listed one below the other. Each hobby is mentioned with an image in the shape of a circle with a border of the same shape. On hovering the size of the image reduces and the border thickens. Not only this but the image starts rotating on hovering. This is the feature I have used here.</p>

<h3>EDUCATIONAL PROFILE</h3>
<p>The educational profile page begins with an animation of a teacher greeting and teaching. This runs infinitely.</p>

<p></p>Below it, I have included my school and college information along with their respective website links. Under the school part, I have included a feature of 'Hover to know my marks' which reveals my marks on hovering over it.</p>
