        <h3>My Projects and other Skills</h3>
        <p>From grade 6 to 10, I have been learning computer applications dealing with languages like HTML, C++ and Java.So, I am aware of the basics of each of these programming languages. It was after coming to college that I have started working on projects like these. This is my first project.</p>
        <p>Coming to skills apart from programming, I can do a little bit of drawing and writing poems.</p>
